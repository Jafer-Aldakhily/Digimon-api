# Digimon-api

In, this project I learned how can I read data using api.

1- you need to know this data will be written in a json formate.

2- I used a fetch method to get data from resourse.

3- I'm putting data in an array and create the 20 objects by them.

4- I created a getData function to read data from Digimon constructor.
